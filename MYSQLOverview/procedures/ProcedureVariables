DECLARE variable_name datatype(size) DEFAULT default_value;


1.  First, you specify the variable name after the DECLARE keyword. 
    The variable name must follow the naming rules of MySQL table column names.
    
2.  Second, you specify the data type of the variable and its size. 
    A variable can have any MySQL data types such as INT, VARCHAR , and DATETIME.
    
3.  Third, when you declare a variable, its initial value is NULL. 
    You can assign the variable a default value using the DEFAULTkeyword.

4.  A variable that begins with the @ sign is session variable. 
    It is available and accessible until the session ends.



VARIABLE SCOPE

1.  f you declare a variable inside a stored procedure, 
    it will be out of scope when the END statement of stored procedure reached.

2.  You can declare two or more variables with the same name in different scopes 
    because a variable is only effective in its own scope.
    
3.  A variable that begins with the @ sign is session variable. 
    It is available and accessible until the session ends.





eg. 

DECLARE total_sale INT DEFAULT 0;
DECLARE x, y INT DEFAULT 0;
