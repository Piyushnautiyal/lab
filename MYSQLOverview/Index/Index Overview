 1. When you query data from a table, first MySQL checks if the indexes exist, 
 then MySQL uses the indexes to select exact physical corresponding 
 rows of the table instead of scanning the whole table.
 
 
 2. If you create an index for every column, MySQL has to build and maintain the index table. 
 Whenever a change is made to the rows of the table, MySQL has to rebuild the index, 
 which takes time as well as decreases the performance of the database server.
 
 
 3. MySQL automatically adds any column that is declared as PRIMARY KEY, KEY , 
 UNIQUE  or INDEX to the index. 
 In addition, you can add indexes to the tables that already have data.
