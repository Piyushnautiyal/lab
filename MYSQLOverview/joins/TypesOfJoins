MySQL JOINS are used to retrieve data from multiple tables. 
A MySQL JOIN is performed whenever two or more tables are joined in a SQL statement.

There are different types of MySQL joins:

MySQL INNER JOIN (or sometimes called simple join)
MySQL LEFT OUTER JOIN (or sometimes called LEFT JOIN)
MySQL RIGHT OUTER JOIN (or sometimes called RIGHT JOIN)
