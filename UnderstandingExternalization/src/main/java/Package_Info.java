/*Externalization serves the purpose of custom Serialization, where we can decide what to store in stream.

* Key differences between Serializable and Externalizable

Implementation : Unlike Serializable interface which will serialize the variables in object with just by implementing interface, 
here we have to explicitly mention what fields or variables you want to serialize.

Methods : Serializable is marker interface without any methods. Externalizable interface contains two methods: writeExternal() 
and readExternal().

Process: Default Serialization process will take place for classes implementing Serializable interface. Programmer defined 
Serialization process for classes implementing Externalizable interface.

Backward Compatibility and Control: If you have to support multiple versions, you can have full control with Externalizable 
interface. You can support different versions of your object. If you implement Externalizable, it�s your responsibility 
to serialize super class.

public No-arg constructor: Serializable uses reflection to construct object and does not require no arg constructor. 
But Externalizable requires public no-arg constructor.
