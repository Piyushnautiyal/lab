While Considering the builder pattern you need to look weather the object is having

1. Complex constructor.

Multiple constructor having combinations of multiple parameter with nested objects

2. Large number of parameters.
having large number of field parameter is also the key point to consider.

3. Immutability.

You can force the immutability to the object once you are done with creation of object.





Pros
1) Code is more maintainable if number of fields required to create object is more than 4 or 5.

2) Object Creation code less error-prone as user will know what they are passing because of explicit method call.

3) Builder pattern increase robustness, as only fully constructed object will be available to client.

4) You can force immutability to the object once its created.


Cons
1) Builder pattern is verbose and requires code duplication as 
Builder needs to copy all fields from Original or Item class.
