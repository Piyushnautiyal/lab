Rehashing is the process of re-calculating the hashcode of already stored 
entries (Key-Value pairs), to move them to another bigger size hashmap when 
Load factor threshold is reached.



Why Rehashing is required? 

If we keep the existing key-value pairs as it is, then doubling the capacity may not help, 
because O(1) complexity will be achieved only if items are evenly distributed across all buckets.

So for each existing key-value pairs, hashcode is calculated again with increased 
hashmap capacity as a parameter, which results in either placing the item in same 
bucket or in different bucket.
