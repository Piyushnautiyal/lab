1. When the total number of items in hashmap goes on increasing keeping 
the default initial capacity of hashmap 16, At one point of time, hashmap performance 
will start degrading and need to increase buckets for improving performance.

2. Load Factor is a measure, which decides when exactly to increase the 
hashmap capacity(buckets) to maintain get and put operation complexity of O(1). 

3. Default load factor of Hashmap is 0.75f (i.e 75% of current map size).

4. You can also say, load factor is a measure "Till what load, hashmap can 
allow elements to put in it before its capacity is automatically increased"

5. initial capacity of hashmap * Load factor of hashmap =  16 * 0.75 = 12. 


load factor	= m/n  

m=total number of elements 
n=total number of buckets
